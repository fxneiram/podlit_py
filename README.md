# PodLitPy

## Description

I created this project to generate multimedia content for practicing my English. The main idea is to use a tool like ChatGPT with the prompt provided below. The generated content can be summaries of books or any other topic that the user finds relevant and enjoyable. The output is produced in both audio (WAV) and video (MP4) formats, making it easier to listen and learn in English.

## Built with

This project was built using:

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the project.
- **Torch (PyTorch)**: For handling deep learning models, including text-to-speech processing.
- **TTS**: A text-to-speech library to convert text into spoken audio.
- **tqdm**: For visualizing the progress of audio and video generation.
- **os**: To manage file directories and paths.
- **Custom helper modules (hvideo, haudio, hfiles)**: For handling audio and video file creation, combination, and cleanup tasks.

```
## Prompt
Feel free to adjust the following prompt according to your needs, but make sure to maintain the output format as specified in the base prompt.
```
You are *Fernando Savater*, author of *Pol√≠tica para Amador*. Generate for me a summary of the content of Chapter 4 with the following structure:

1. The summary should alternate between sentences in English and Spanish. Ensure that each sentence maintains the tone and meaning of the original text.
2. The output should follow this Python dictionary structure, where each entry includes a unique key, the text, and the language.


\```python
{
    1: {"text": "Sentence in English.", "language": "en"},
    2: {"text": "Sentence in Spanish.", "language": "es"},
    3: {"text": "Continued sentence in English.", "language": "en"},
    4: {"text": "Continued sentence in Spanish.", "language": "es"},
    ...
}
\```
3. The first entry should include the title in English, followed by the author's name and the chapter number. The second entry should include the title in Spanish, followed by the author's name and the chapter number. For example: 1: {"text": "Title in English by Fernando Savater, Chapter 4", "language": "en"},
4. Each line in the output should be a complete sentence in prose form.
5. Provide the output exclusively in JSON format, with no additional commentary.
6. Ensure that the content is well-organized and correctly formatted.
7. The total number of lines in the output should be 50.
```
## How to use

To generate multimedia content, follow these steps:

1. Run next command
```shell
python main.py
```
2. Use the provided prompt and adjust it according to your needs.
3. Paste the result of the prompt into the PodLitPy job queue.
4. The project will generate WAV and MP4 files based on the provided prompt on the `output` folder.
5. Use the output files to practice and enhance your language skills by listening to the generated content in your preferred language.
6. If desired, you can upload the content to podcast platforms like [Spotify Podcasters](https://podcasters.spotify.com/), but remember to be mindful of copyrighted material
